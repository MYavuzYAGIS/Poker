A small tool for automating early-recon phase trivial enums for pentesting.

**Not** a top-notch quality code,but rather a dirty and quick one.

usage: poker --url https://xyz.dev


-- checks robots.txt

-- checks hidden html comments.

-- checks various login pages.

-- checks non-standard Javascript files.

-- searches "/" page source for interesting keywords.

-- checks cookies.

-- lists given urls in the page.

-- lists image names and locations.

These things can be boring to handle manually, distracting, and time consuming. Hence let the gopher deal with it.

**currently WIP.**
